# YouTube Data Engineering and Analysis with AWS

## Overview
This project focuses on efficiently managing and analyzing structured and semi-structured YouTube video data, categorized by video types and trending metrics, while ensuring secure processing.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Ingestion**: Implement a system to collect data from multiple sources.
- **ETL Process**: Transform raw data into a refined, usable format.
- **Data Lake**: Establish a centralized repository to store data from various sources.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the system can handle growing data volumes as they increase over time.
- **Cloud Integration**: Leverage AWS cloud services to process large datasets beyond local machine capacity.
- **Reporting**: Develop dashboards to address the key questions and insights derived from the analysis.

## Services We Will Be Using
- **Amazon S3**: An object storage service offering unmatched scalability, data availability, security, and performance for storing and retrieving any amount of data.
- **AWS IAM**: Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables secure access control for AWS services and resources, ensuring proper permissions and security protocols.
- **Amazon QuickSight**: A cloud-native business intelligence (BI) service that offers powerful, serverless, and scalable analytics with embedded machine learning capabilities.
- **AWS Glue**: A serverless data integration tool that simplifies discovering, preparing, and merging data for analytics, machine learning, and app development.
- **AWS Lambda**: A compute service that allows you to execute code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers.
- **AWS Athena**: An interactive query service that enables users to analyze data directly in S3 using SQL without the need for data loading or managing databases.

## Dataset Used
This project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle that provides daily statistics on popular YouTube videos over several months. It includes data for up to 200 trending videos per day across different regions. Each regionâ€™s data is stored in separate files, containing information such as video title, channel title, publication date, tags, views, likes, dislikes, descriptions, and comment count. The dataset also includes a `category_id` field, unique to each region, linked to a corresponding JSON file.
